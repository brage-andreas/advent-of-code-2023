# Advent of Code 2023

This is a repository containing my solutions for Advent of Code 2023.
I am using Rust, and you can find the source files `part_1.rs` and `part_2.rs` under `day-xx/src/bin/` for their respective days.
Note: The solution (if solved) will be present in the source file at the bottom, under the tests module.
